The analysis script reads in daily attendance data held by schools, cleans this data and summarises the rate of persistent absence and rate of persistent unauthorised absence by year and previous attendance history.

Note: to use this script, you need pupil-level, daily or session-level attendance data for multiple terms or acedemic years. The code can be adapted depending on what data is available but generally, for each term or academic year, you need a table with a pupil idetifier variable, a date variable, a session variable (AM/PM) and an attendance code variable.
